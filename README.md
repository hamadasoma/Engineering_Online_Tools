This repo description is the same as <a href="https://github.com/hamadasoma/Loadcell_FlaskApp">Loadcell_FlaskApp</a>, but I extended the idea to cover more engineering tools and interests.<br>
Enjoy the application alife at <a href="https://hamadasoma.pythonanywhere.com">my pythonanywhere</a>. You will find some differences in the output interface for the data analysis section because that <a href=https://www.pythonanywhere.com">pythonanywhere</a> is not supporting python versions higher than 3.4
<br>In this project I am using python 3.7 and flask 1.0
